🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
For students: Personalized tutoring is often expensive and limited in availability.

For teachers/institutions: Manually creating exams is time-consuming and inconsistent.

For ed-tech platforms: Scaling tutoring and assessment to many learners is hard without automation.

For parents: Hard to track children’s real academic progress without structured assessments.

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
High intensity in developing countries (like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan): Large student population, teacher shortages, inconsistent quality of education.

Moderate in developed countries: Quality is higher, but demand exists for personalized learning and faster grading tools.

Globally post-COVID: Hybrid/online learning increased demand for automated tools.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes, if you focus on:

B2C: Parents & students will pay for:

Personalized tutoring

Practice tests before board/college exams

B2B: Schools, coaching centers, edtech platforms will pay for:

Bulk exam generation

Analytics on student performance

Freemium models work well (limited free usage → paid upgrade for full analytics/content).

👥 4. Who Are the Customers?
Students (Grades 5–12, college)

Parents of school-going children

Coaching centers/tutors

Schools and universities

Ed-tech platforms (local and global)
