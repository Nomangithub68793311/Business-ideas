🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
Traditional education systems:

Often identify struggling students too late (after exams or dropout).

Teachers have limited time and data insight to track every student.

The Student Performance Predictor solves:

🎯 Early detection of at-risk students based on attendance, grades, behavior, and engagement.

📉 Reduces dropouts and failure rates.

📊 Gives teachers/admins a data-backed view of student risk.

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
Extremely high in schools/colleges with large student populations.

In Bangladesh, India, Africa: dropouts are a major concern—this tool offers preventive intervention.

Even in developed countries, schools face pressure to improve pass rates and reduce academic failure.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes, because it delivers measurable academic value and helps improve:

Pass rates

Retention rates

School performance in rankings

🎯 Paid users may include:

Principals and school admins

Coaching centers (who promise guaranteed results)

Edtech platforms (offering smart learning solutions)

👥 4. Who Are the Customers?
Private schools and colleges

Education boards or government institutions

Coaching centers

NGOs running large learning programs

EdTech platforms with LMS or tutoring

⚔️ 5. Other Tools to Compare
Schoolytics, BrightBytes, PowerSchool (US): Offer analytics dashboards but are expensive and not AI-first.

Edunext, Fedena: Popular Indian LMSs with basic reporting, no real AI predictions.

Knewton, DreamBox Learning: Adaptive learning platforms, but not focused on risk detection.

✅ There's a gap for low-cost, AI-based student risk predictors—especially in South Asia.

📈 6. Market Growth
