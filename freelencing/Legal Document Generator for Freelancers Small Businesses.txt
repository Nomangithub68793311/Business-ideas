🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
Most freelancers and small businesses:

Don’t know how to draft legally sound contracts, NDAs, or terms of service.

Copy templates from the internet → leads to legal gaps or disputes.

Avoid lawyers due to high costs and complexity.

✅ This tool solves that by:

Letting users generate custom legal documents (contracts, NDAs, ToS, privacy policies) using AI.

Tailoring documents to their industry, region, and risk level.

Ensuring legality while avoiding lawyer fees or legalese confusion.

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
Very high intensity, because:

Contracts define ownership, payments, rights, and liabilities.

Many freelancers lose money due to vague or missing agreements.

Legal disputes can kill trust and lead to lawsuits or non-payment.

🧨 Most small businesses delay legal docs until something goes wrong.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Absolutely.

Freelancers and startups prefer one-time, low-cost legal support over expensive lawyers.

A clear contract helps get paid on time, avoid scope creep, and protect IP.

💵 Pricing models:

Pay-per-document (e.g., $5–$20)

Monthly subscription (e.g., $10–$25/mo for unlimited docs)

Bundles for agencies/startups (with legal audit/consult upsell)

👥 4. Who Are the Customers?
Freelancers (dev, design, writing, marketing, etc.)

Solo founders/startups

Digital agencies

Consultants and coaches

eCommerce store owners

Creators and influencers (collab contracts, sponsorships, etc.)
