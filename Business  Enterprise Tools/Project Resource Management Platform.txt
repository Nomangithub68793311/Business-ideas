✅ What Problem Does It Solve?
Inefficient Resource Allocation: Most companies manually assign people to projects using spreadsheets or simplistic tools. This leads to overbooking, underutilization, and missed deadlines.

Poor Project Visibility: Project managers struggle to see real-time workload and availability across teams.

Mismatched Skills: People are often assigned without considering the best skill fit, slowing down project delivery.

Schedule Conflicts: AI can dynamically reschedule when things change (e.g., someone goes on leave or a task gets delayed).

🔥 How Intense Is the Problem?
High in medium to large service-based companies (agencies, software firms, consulting, construction).

Mismanaged resources lead to:

Delayed projects (lost revenue)

Employee burnout

Client dissatisfaction

In companies with >20 people working on multiple projects, this becomes a daily pain.

💰 Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes—if:

The system integrates with their current tools (Slack, Jira, Asana, MS Teams).

It offers clear ROI: fewer missed deadlines, better billable utilization, improved employee satisfaction.

Companies already pay for:

ClickUp, Monday, Asana, Resource Guru, Float (none use advanced AI deeply).

AI-based scheduling is a compelling differentiator.
