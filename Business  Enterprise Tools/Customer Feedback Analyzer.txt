🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
Companies get feedback from many channels (support tickets, reviews, surveys, social media) but:

Don’t have time to read and analyze all of it

Miss key insights (e.g., repeated complaints, product issues)

Can’t identify emerging trends or sentiment shifts

Rely on gut feeling or manual tagging, which is slow and biased

✅ This tool will:

Automatically analyze text feedback using AI (NLP)

Group similar issues (e.g., “login problem” mentioned 30+ times)

Detect sentiment and urgency

Provide visual dashboards to product, marketing, and support teams

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
Very intense, especially for:

SaaS products

eCommerce platforms

Service providers

B2C companies

Missed or late insights lead to:

Churn

Bad reviews

Wasted marketing or dev efforts

This is a real-time problem that’s only growing as customer interactions increase.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes — because it saves time and reveals insights that protect revenue.

💵 Pricing models:

Freemium or trial-based

SaaS tiers (based on number of feedback entries/month):

Starter: $49/month

Growth: $149/month

Pro: $399+/month (integrations + API)

High ROI — even one key insight can improve product or reduce churn.

👥 4. Who Are the Customers?
Product managers

Customer experience teams

Founders/CEOs of B2C startups

Marketing teams (brand sentiment)

UX researchers

eCommerce businesses

EdTech/SaaS companies

Mobile app developers

⚔️ 5. What Tools Compete?
MonkeyLearn – Text analysis platform, needs manual setup

Thematic – Enterprise-level feedback analysis

Qualtrics XM – Expensive, complex

Survicate, Delighted – Good for collecting feedback but weak AI analysis

✅ Opportunity: Lightweight, affordable tool focused only on AI-based analysis from any feedback source.
