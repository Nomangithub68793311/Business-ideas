🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
Most online stores:

Set static prices manually

Can’t keep up with frequent changes in competitor prices

Don’t adjust prices based on demand, stock levels, or seasonality

Miss out on sales or lose profit margins

✅ A dynamic pricing engine will:

Analyze competitor prices, inventory, and demand signals

Suggest or auto-adjust prices in real time

Optimize for profit, conversion, or stock clearance

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
Very intense for:

eCommerce businesses with 100+ SKUs

Sellers on marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart, Daraz, etc.

Retailers with thin margins or fast-moving stock

Poor pricing = lower sales, excess inventory, or lost margins.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes — this tool directly impacts revenue and profit.

💵 Pricing:

SaaS model by SKU volume or usage:

Starter: $49/month (up to 500 SKUs)

Growth: $149–$299/month (5000 SKUs)

Enterprise: Custom (integrations, rule logic)

If it helps improve pricing strategy by even 2–3%, customers save thousands monthly.

👥 4. Who Are the Customers?
Mid-size online retailers

Amazon/eBay/Daraz sellers

Shopify/WooCommerce stores

Electronics, fashion, grocery sellers
