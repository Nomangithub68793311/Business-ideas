🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
Real estate and construction sectors face:

Unplanned equipment failure (elevators, HVAC, plumbing, etc.)

Missed maintenance schedules → costly downtime and repairs

Manual tracking (Excel, paper) → inefficiency & human error

Lack of visibility for property managers or construction site supervisors

✅ This tool solves the problem by:

Tracking all assets (e.g., AC units, pumps, lighting, fire alarms)

Sending automated reminders before service is due

Using AI to predict breakdowns based on past service data and runtime

Helping teams prevent costly failures, extend asset life, and optimize technician dispatching

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
Very high, especially in:

Large apartment complexes or commercial buildings

Active construction sites managing hundreds of tools/machines

Facilities where downtime = high cost or liability (hospitals, factories, hotels)

🛠 A single equipment failure can cost thousands or delay projects — predictive maintenance saves both money and reputation.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes — because:

Prevents major repair costs and downtime

Reduces manual overhead

Gives clear reports for compliance or audits

💵 Potential pricing:

Per-building model ($50–200/month depending on size)

SaaS per user/device ($10–25/user/month)

Enterprise licenses for facility management companies

👥 4. Who Are the Customers?
Property management companies (residential and commercial)

Real estate developers

Construction companies

Facility managers for malls, hospitals, schools, hotels, etc.

Industrial site managers

⚔️ 5. Other Tools to Compare
UpKeep – CMMS with scheduling & asset tracking

Fiix – Predictive maintenance but more focused on factories

Hippo CMMS – User-friendly but expensive for small teams

IBM Maximo / SAP – Enterprise-grade, but very complex and costly

✅ Gap: Most tools are either too simple or too complex. There's room for a mid-tier, affordable solution focused on real estate & construction with AI-powered predictions.
