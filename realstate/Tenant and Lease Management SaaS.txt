🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
Property owners and real estate developers struggle with:

Manually tracking lease agreements (renewals, terminations, rent changes)

Delayed rent collection and poor payment visibility

Poor tenant communication and complaint management

Legal risks due to missed renewals or expired contracts

No centralized view of property occupancy, revenue, or churn

✅ Your SaaS platform would:

Automate lease tracking, rent invoicing, and renewal reminders

Provide dashboards for rent status, unit occupancy, tenant churn

Offer secure document storage and digital signing

Manage tenant support requests or complaints

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
Very high, especially in:

Multi-property landlords or developers (10+ units)

Growing real estate portfolios with mixed-use properties (residential + commercial)

Developers managing hundreds of unsold or rented units

Manual lease/rent tracking is prone to human error, loss of revenue, and tenant dissatisfaction.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes, because it saves them time, legal hassle, and revenue leakage.

💵 Pricing models:

Per unit: $1–3/month/unit

Tiered SaaS:

Starter (up to 20 units): $29/month

Pro (100+ units): $99–199/month

Enterprise pricing for large property managers

👥 4. Who Are the Customers?
Real estate developers (renting out unsold flats)

Residential and commercial landlords

Property management companies

Real estate investment firms

Co-living space operators

Mixed-use or community housing developers

⚔️ 5. Other Tools to Compare
Buildium – Powerful, U.S.-focused, for medium to large PMs

TenantCloud – Good for small landlords, limited automation

AppFolio / Propertyware – Feature-rich but expensive

Stessa / Hemlane / Rentec Direct – Entry-level, focused on the U.S.

✅ Gap: Few tools are optimized for emerging markets (like South Asia or Middle East), construction firms, or mid-size landlords managing 10–200 units.
