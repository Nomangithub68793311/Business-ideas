🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
✅ A. Access & Overcrowding
Many people can’t access doctors quickly (especially in rural or low-resource areas).

In urban areas, hospitals are overloaded with minor, non-urgent cases.

✅ B. Poor Self-Diagnosis
Patients Google symptoms and panic, often misdiagnosing themselves.

Leads to unnecessary hospital visits or ignoring serious issues.

💡 This app:

Lets users describe symptoms, get instant AI-generated preliminary suggestions, and book a teleconsultation.

Reduces unnecessary visits and guides users to the right care path.

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
Extremely intense, especially in:

South Asia, Africa, Latin America, where doctor-patient ratios are low.

Post-COVID era where telehealth demand has grown 10x.

In Bangladesh, India, etc., many rural patients travel hours for minor symptoms. An AI + telemedicine combo saves time, money, and strain on healthcare.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes, especially if positioned well:

Urban users pay ₹199–₹799 / ৳300–৳1000 for virtual doctor consults.

AI checker adds trust + pre-diagnosis, improving perceived value.

B2B model: clinics and hospitals can use it to triage and reduce burden.

Freemium possible: free AI check, pay to talk to real doctor.

Individuals with non-critical symptoms

Rural patients without nearby doctors
