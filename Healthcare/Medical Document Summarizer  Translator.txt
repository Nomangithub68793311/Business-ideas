🧩 1. What Problem Does It Solve?
This system addresses two major issues:

✅ A. Operational Inefficiency
Manual appointment booking, patient records, billing, etc.

Errors in documentation and data entry

Poor coordination across departments

✅ B. Patient Triage Bottlenecks
Long queues, especially for minor/non-urgent issues

No initial screening, leading to wasted doctor time

Delays in identifying critical cases

💡 AI Triage Assistant pre-screens symptoms, asks relevant questions, and suggests urgency level before patients see a doctor.

🔥 2. How Intense is the Problem?
Very intense, especially in:

Busy outpatient departments

Rural clinics with limited staff

Hospitals overwhelmed with both serious and minor cases

AI triage helps optimize resource use and saves lives by escalating urgent cases early.

💰 3. Will Customers Pay for It?
Yes, because:

It improves clinical workflows

Saves time for doctors/nurses

Reduces patient waiting time

Increases throughput without hiring extra staff

💵 Hospitals and clinics already pay for HMS systems — this adds AI value.

👥 4. Who Are the Customers?
Private clinics (1–20 doctors)

Diagnostic centers

Medium & large hospitals
